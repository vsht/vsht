Hello! I'm Vladyslav Shtabovenko, a [postdoctoral researcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) in [High Energy Physics (HEP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics).

Currently I'm on my [third postdoc](https://www.physik.uni-siegen.de/tp1/staff/professors-and-project-investigators/) in the [Theoretical Particle Physics Group](https://www.physik.uni-siegen.de/tp1/), at [University of Siegen](https://www.uni-siegen.de/) in [Siegen](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/50.8863/8.0471), Germany.

I received my PhD (Dr. rer. nat) in theoretical particle physics from the \
[Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/) in 2017.
